# PLANNED FEATURES
- Blocks
  - 3 copper ingot into an EXTRUDER machine to make a CABLE
    - Explodes on excess power consumed
  - 3 CABLE into a Binder machine to make a super-cable
    - carries 9* the power
    - Big Explode on excess power consumed
  - Pipe
    - To carry lava, water, radioactive byproduct, other?
    - Made from stone in Extruder (concept: melt to 'concrete' and form into tube)
    - Radioactive contents makes pipe radioactive
- Extruder
  - Generates cable from Copper ingots (3) using Lava to melt them, piston to push, hopper to extrude
  - Must be buildable without machines
  - Must be able to run without power (feed lava)
  - with power the lava feed is not needed?
- Generator
  - Steam - power capacity based on fuel
    - fuel to power generation
      - wood - 1/2 power, short runtime 
      - Coal - 1/2 power of cable
      - lava - 1 power of cable
    - needs pipe input for water
    - another pipe if lava in use
    - Solid input (hopper) if coal in use
  - Water - 1/9th power capacity of a cable
  - Solar - 1/3rd power capacity of a cable
  - Lightning Rod (exists in Minecraft already)
    - LOTS OF POWER
    - Needs a lightning strike
    - You probably want a battery to store the power generated!
    - NEEDS super-cable, probably more than one?
  - Atomic - Capacity of a Super-Cable
    - Add radioactive block to world generator
      - Kills player 1 heart per second when within 8 blocks, faster if closer
    - Add radioactive protective gear
    - Add radioactive detector - like compass but for radioactive block
    - Add complex generator build
    - Add massive explosion when things go wrong
    - Add waste byproduct (liquid)
      - cannot be placed in anything (e.g. itself, water, lava, other?), target block must be empty
        - Implicitly this means it is not destroyed by lava
      - Radioactive, so kills player when within 8 blocks
      - Accumulates forever, expanding (matches reality, needs maintenance)
        - use the Pump in reverse to PLACE liquid into an empty area
- Binder
    - Takes cable (3) and twists them into super-cable (9 times the carrying power)
    - requires power to operate
- Battery
  - stores power to deliver when generator(s) down (e.g. nighttime for solar)
    - Capacity?
  - Can be used to build up power - e.g. to store until enough
- Transducer
  - reversible
  - convert solid/liquid to energy for moving through cables
  - convert energy to solid/liquid for inserting into machines
  - Filter setting to determine WHAT is processed
    - if cable has multiple items flowing through it, this transducer will only covert selected
    - Should multi-selection be possible?  (e.g. for filling chests with more than one item type)
- Pump
  - Liquid Extractor, reversible to Liquid Placer
  - Pump lava, water, etc
  - power needs based on distance to block be processed (more power to reach further away)
- Quarry
  - extract solids from an area
  - power needs based on distance to block be processed (more power to reach further away)
- Electric Vehicles
  - TRUCK
    - carry blocks placed on it?
    - Has a chest you put your items into?
  - CAR
    - multi-block shape
    - Like horse but you sit inside it
    - protection from mobs when inside
    - Needs flat surface or stairs

# TOO HARD, DON'T TRY
Bugs that are too hard to fix, but we may get to one-day
