# PLANNED FEATURES
- Blocks
  - CABLE
    - TODO
      - 3 copper ingot into an EXTRUDER machine to make a CABLE
      - Limit on excess power consumed
    - DONE
      - **Interim** implementation takes 3 horizontal copper in crafting table to make Cable
  - SUPER_CABLE
    - TODO
      - 3 CABLE into a Binder machine to make a super-cable
      - carries 9* the power
      - Limit on excess power consumed
      - **Interim** implementation takes 3 horizontal cable in crafting table to make super cable
  - PIPE
    - TODO
      - To carry lava, water, radioactive byproduct, other?
      - Made from stone in Extruder (concept: melt to 'concrete' and form into tube)
      - Radioactive contents makes pipe radioactive
- Extruder
  - TODO
    - Generates cable from Copper ingots (3) using Lava to melt them, piston to push, hopper to extrude
    - Must be buildable without machines
      - STONE   CHEST   STONE
      - FURNACE FURNACE FURNACE
      - PISTON  HOPPER  PISTON
    - Must be able to run without power (feed lava)
    - with power the lava feed is not needed?
- Generator
  - TODO
    - Steam - power capacity based on fuel
      - fuel to power generation
        - wood - 1/2 power, short runtime 
        - Coal - 1/2 power of cable
        - lava - 1 power of cable
      - needs pipe input for water
      - another pipe if lava in use
      - Solid input (hopper) if coal in use
    - Water - 1/9th power capacity of a cable
    - Solar - 1/3rd power capacity of a cable
    - Lightning Rod (exists in Minecraft already)
      - LOTS OF POWER
      - Needs a lightning strike
      - You probably want a battery to store the power generated!
      - NEEDS super-cable, probably more than one?
    - Atomic - Capacity of a Super-Cable
      - Add radioactive block to world generator
        - Kills player 1 heart per second when within 8 blocks, faster if closer
      - Add radioactive protective gear
      - Add radioactive detector - like compass but for radioactive block
      - Add complex generator build
      - Add massive explosion when things go wrong
      - Add waste byproduct (liquid)
        - cannot be placed in anything (e.g. itself, water, lava, other?), target block must be empty
          - Implicitly this means it is not destroyed by lava
        - Radioactive, so kills player when within 8 blocks
        - Accumulates forever, expanding (matches reality, needs maintenance)
          - use the Pump in reverse to PLACE liquid into an empty area
- Binder
  - TODO
    - Takes cable (3) and twists them into super-cable (9 times the carrying power)
    - requires power to operate
- Battery
  - TODO
    - stores power to deliver when generator(s) down (e.g. nighttime for solar)
      - Capacity?
    - Can be used to build up power - e.g. to store until enough
- Transducer
  - Converts matter into energy or energy into matter for transport through cables
  - TODO
    - UI to provide conversion direction (to or from energy)
    - Must not convert energy to matter unless the matter was in the cable as energy first
    - matter can be solid or liquid? (must be a liquid that exists as a block, not flowing)
    - Filter setting to determine WHAT is processed
      - if cable has multiple items flowing through it, this transducer will only covert selected
      - Should multi-selection be possible?  (e.g. for filling chests with more than one item type)
        - This could be an 'advancement' on the device, e.g. adding a 'booster' component
- Pump
  - TODO
    - Liquid Extractor, reversible to Liquid Placer
    - Pump lava, water, etc
    - power needs based on distance to block be processed (more power to reach further away)
    - Or :-( limit the area it can reach
- Quarry
  - TODO
    - extract solids from an area
    - power needs based on distance to block be processed (more power to reach further away)
    - Or :-( limit the area it can reach
- Jet Pack
  - TODO
    - Smaller battery recipe
- Charging station
  - TODO
    - For jetpack, small battery, ...
- Electric Vehicles
  - Josh thinks vehicles are not needed or wanted
  - TODO
    - TRUCK
      - carry blocks placed on it?
      - Has a chest you put your items into?
      - auto-drive capability
        - routing instructions stored with vehicle (A S D W sequences (+ load/unload?))
    - CAR
      - multi-block shape
      - Like horse but you sit inside it
      - protection from mobs when inside
      - Needs flat surface or stairs
      - auto-drive capability
        - See TRUCK

# TOO HARD, DON'T TRY
Bugs that are too hard to fix, but we may get to one-day
- Everything else

# FIXED BUGS
- Cable block is making the blocks it is placed on transparent, can see through world
  - set .noOcclusion() in block init
